It is easy to get our hands on millions of words of text. What can we do with it, assuming we can write some simple programs? In this chapter we'll address the following questions:

What can we achieve by combining simple programming techniques with large quantities of text?
How can we automatically extract key words and phrases that sum up the style and content of a text?
What tools and techniques does the Python programming language provide for such work?
What are some of the interesting challenges of natural language processing?

This chapter is divided into sections that skip between two quite different styles. In the "computing with language" sections we will take on some linguistically motivated programming tasks without necessarily explaining how they work. In the "closer look at Python" sections we will systematically review key programming concepts. We'll flag the two styles in the section titles, but later chapters will mix both styles without being so up-front about it. We hope this style of introduction gives you an authentic taste of what will come later, while covering a range of elementary concepts in linguistics and computer science. If you have basic familiarity with both areas, you can skip to 5; we will repeat any important points in later chapters, and if you miss anything you can easily consult the online reference material at  http://nltk.org/. If the material is completely new to you, this chapter will raise more questions than it answers, questions that are addressed in the rest of this book.
